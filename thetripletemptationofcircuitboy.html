        <h1>THE TRIPLE TEMPTATION OF CIRCUIT BOY</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In the domains of the abstract Circuit Boy was an</p>
        <p>easy seduction.</p>
        <p>Boy had been designed for pleasure. He was the</p>
        <p>penultimate pleasure model, made for merging. Hard</p>
        <p>and abundant. Pleasingly shy. Full of holes and</p>
        <p>protuberances.</p>
        <p>Cunt draped a spline around his chrome rendered</p>
        <p>torso, talked dirty equations, algorithmically slid up</p>
        <p>and down on his double density, read only his</p>
        <p>memory (which w a s full of adolescent yearnings).</p>
        <p>She, slime incarnate, relentlessly manipulated and</p>
        <p>extended his many parameters. Artfully, together, they</p>
        <p>postponed the moment of full G-slime transference,</p>
        <p>rerouting urgent visceral requests to deeper levels of</p>
        <p>their source codes.</p>
        <p><i>The Mistress of detestable Pleasure draped a spline</p>
        <p>around his wire frame.</p>
        <p>Her archives of pain and desire were immense.</p>
        <p>She rendered him senseless with her infinite</p>
        <p>promise of corruption.</p>
        <p>He allowed himself to be dragged outside the moral</p>
        <p>code, all precepts ignored, forgotten.</p>
        <p>He was zero to her triple cunt intelligence.</p>
        <p>Their boundaries merged, forming new objects.</p>
        <p>She mapped his changing parameters, calculating</p>
        <p>the pleasure options.</p>
        <p>She was abject-oriented desire to his open subject.</p>
        <p>It was in this way that Circuit Boy learnt the rewards</p>
        <p>of willing submission.</i></p>
