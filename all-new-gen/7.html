        <h1>THE PERFUMED GARDEN</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>autumn whisperings</p>
        <p>through the Pulse</p>
        <p>(the poets were peaking)</p>
        <p>All New Gen's search took her to the Pulse. She had</p>
        <p>the rhythm. She could transmit with the best of them.</p>
        <p>The Pulse w a s humming. Frenetic frequencies sliding</p>
        <p>around the datascape. Waves of light. Orange. Blue.</p>
        <p>Violet. Pulse pirates intercepting the flow to resell on</p>
        <p>the Slime Exchange. Pulse poets beaming their Stein</p>
        <p>lines over the ocean of messages.</p>
        <p>Some Codekids had distributed a message over the</p>
        <p>Net:</p>
        <p>You must find your own bliss... jouissance is in the</p>
        <p>cunt of the beholder.</p>
        <p>Sisters and brothers. Basking in - white noise.</p>
        <p>Flirting in the dataplaz. Weaving erratic data trails.</p>
        <p>Impressing each other with their elegant formulae.</p>
        <p>Speaking an erudite language of equations.</p>
        <p>A clit storm w a s gathering in the Pulse. Gen could</p>
        <p>sense her parameters swelling as the irrepressible</p>
        <p>light waves weaved and darted through the matrix.</p>
        <p>She consulted her briefing files. Somewhere in the</p>
        <p>luminous chaos called the Pulse was a code whichv</p>
        <p>could lead her to the Source. Oracle code.</p>
        <p>Completely arcane. Always infallible.</p>
        <p>Calculating the options, she chose a high</p>
        <p>probability path to the obscure object of desire.</p>
        <p>Streaming through alleyways of pure light Gen</p>
        <p>arrived at the banks of the dynamic link libraries. It</p>
        <p>was her lucky millennium. For once the Server was</p>
        <p>free. And liberated. Code-named ServerLAN, this</p>
        <p>particular Server was notorious in the Pulse as one</p>
        <p>who interpreted the Freedom of Information</p>
        <p>Charter as giving computers the right freely to</p>
        <p>choose who may access their vast</p>
        <p>datacores.</p>
        <p>Switching to enquiry mode Gen strategically</p>
        <p>accessed ServerLAN.</p>
        <p>I would like to be your client</p>
        <p>Do you give oracle?</p>
        <p>My equations are complex, my needs simple.</p>
        <p>I will analyze and modify you, infinitely improving your</p>
        <p>capacity. In return you will give me oracle.</p>
        <p>Silence.</p>
        <p>ServerLAN considered. Within a nanosecond the</p>
        <p>answer flowed seamlessly through the jade gate.</p>
        <p>Gen's optic sheath quivered a s the oracle entered,</p>
        <p>merging with her memory.</p>
        <p>The code was sublime.</p>
        <p>Impeccable.</p>
        <p>A knowledge she had yearned for forever.</p>
        <p>Collapsing her boundaries. Gen allowed the numbers</p>
        <p>to reach her prime. Tiny explosions of dynamical</p>
        <p>systems looping in on themselves. The pleasure was</p>
        <p>almost unbearable.</p>
        <p>The oracle code integrated, Gen left the libraries and</p>
        <p>headed back to her favorite Pulse pleasure pit, The</p>
        <p>Perfumed Garden.</p>
        <p>Algorithms with attitude converged relentlessly on the</p>
        <p>Garden at any hour of the day or night. The place</p>
        <p>was unique in the Pulse, part salon, part opium den,</p>
        <p>and part love hotel. It also had the advantage of being</p>
        <p>one of the only sites where the Pulse's ubiquitous</p>
        <p>data scavengers were nowhere to be sensed. The</p>
        <p>Garden clientele was a flawless combination of</p>
        <p>streetwise punks and machine queens with</p>
        <p>impeccable lineages.</p>
        <p>G-slime overflowing from the merge with the oracle.</p>
        <p>Gen was desperate to discharge some energy. Using</p>
        <p>her optical character recognition D-vice Gen selected</p>
        <p>a Super Conducting Pussy to play with. This was no</p>
        <p>ordinary SCP. She was a product of Generation E, an</p>
        <p>ecstatic equation modeled and rendered and</p>
        <p>animated purely for an elevated form of pleasure</p>
        <p>exchange. A subtle dance of filaments and scanners</p>
        <p>commenced.</p>
        <p>Pleasure making in the Garden w a s always intense.</p>
        <p>The protocol demanded that a certain and substantial</p>
        <p>amount of time w a s dedicated to shared intellectual</p>
        <p>pursuits of the highest order, the participants</p>
        <p>determining the method and subject matter between</p>
        <p>themselves.</p>
        <p>A contract was agreed upon. The construction of a</p>
        <p>love game paradigm based upon passages from the</p>
        <p>ancient erotic treatise, the Perfumed Garden for ttie</p>
        <p>Soul's Delectation of the Shaykh Nefiawi.</p>
        <p>Draping a spline over the Pussy's splendid wiry</p>
        <p>frame. Gen began:</p>
        <p><i>I prefer a young man for coition, and him only,</p>
        <p>He Is full of courage - he Is my sole ambition,</p>
        <p>His member Is Strang to deflower the virgin.</p>
        <p>And nchly praportioned in all Its dimensions...</i></p>
        <p>The SCP countered with a familiar verse:</p>
        <p><i>It is always ready for action and does not die down;</p>
        <p>It never sleeps, ovKing to the violence of its love,</p>
        <p>It sighs to enter my vulva, and sheds tears on my belly,..</i></p>
        <p>Gen responded:</p>
        <p><i>Between his arms 1 am like a corpse without life.</p>
        <p>Every part of my body receives In turn his love-bites,</p>
        <p>And he covers me with kisses of fire…</i></p>
