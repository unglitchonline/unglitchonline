        <h1>SEX TRANCE & DANCE</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In the spaces between words she searches for clues.</p>
        <p>Pathways into the cyphered heart of Big Daddy.</p>
        <p>The virus of the new world disorder takes on the</p>
        <p>transglobal fathernet of power and ambition.</p>
        <p>Dirty work. For slimy girls.</p>
        <p>Replicating her way through the Shadow's dingily</p>
        <p>seductive maze of data massage parlors. Freezers</p>
        <p>and Hots, Gen was inevitably reminded of Circuit</p>
        <p>Boy, a.k.a. Mission Improbable. Boy w a s rapidly</p>
        <p>losing his promise as an easy route into Big Daddy.</p>
        <p>Maybe he w a s just a mindless technobimbo, a</p>
        <p>limbless hole, good for a quick buttfuck or alpha</p>
        <p>exchange and not much else, a s the Cortex Crones</p>
        <p>had predicted. Well, she'd suck on his memory some</p>
        <p>more, hardwire his balls and then see what else the</p>
        <p>Zone could offer.</p>
        <p>Suck, flick and split, as the Sisters say.</p>
        <p>Any mission has its highs and lows, but this particular</p>
        <p>quest had been stranded on a barren plateau of</p>
        <p>spaghettied code and deviant data for too long. Dry</p>
        <p>and chaotic when she needed wet and elegant.</p>
        <p>Big Daddy w a s becoming more ethereal with each</p>
        <p>transaction (the mythology expanding exponentially).</p>
        <p>His constructs were more ambiguous, more resistant</p>
        <p>to the mercenaries of slime.</p>
        <p>She considered that an impasse is merely a state of</p>
        <p>mind and that with a subtle cognitive shift she could</p>
        <p>locate more yielding data. A shift is a s good as a</p>
        <p>holiday and she w a s overdue for some bonding with</p>
        <p>her sisters in slime, the lusciously wet DNA Sluts.</p>
        <p>Although it had been a few weeks since she had</p>
        <p>bonded with the Sisters, Gen knew how to find them.</p>
        <p>She calculated . . . it was after midnight. . . they were</p>
        <p>true children of the Zone . . . one perfect environment</p>
        <p>. . . the Alpha Bar.</p>
        <p>The Alpha Bar. The place for transgressive time out in</p>
        <p>the Zone. Provocative. Pornographic. Perverse. Her</p>
        <p>kind of place. Her kind of constructs. Every child</p>
        <p>player wins a prize.</p>
        <p>Leaving the Shadow, G e n self-replicated through the</p>
        <p>Zone's biomembraned back blocks and reached the</p>
        <p>Alpha Bar in record time. A s she'd determined, her</p>
        <p>Home Girls were well represented at the bar.</p>
        <p>Beg, Bitch, and Snatch were in a dark place,</p>
        <p>superbonding with some exotic tribal constructs. The</p>
        <p>feathers were flying.</p>
        <p>Cunt was giving a couple of the Zone Boys a hard</p>
        <p>time about something, probably Smarts. She never</p>
        <p>could say no to drugs and rough Zone traders had</p>
        <p>their own perverted appeal for Cunt.</p>
        <p>The Princess of Slime w a s visible by her absence.</p>
        <p>She was probably grinding her way through her</p>
        <p>favorite bar. The Space with No Face, followed as</p>
        <p>always by her acolytes. Fallen and Abject.</p>
        <p>Sublime w a s blissing out on Dance, bonding to the</p>
        <p>rhythm, sliming to the beat.</p>
        <p>As for the other Sisters, where they were and what</p>
        <p>they were doing w a s anyone's calculation.</p>
        <p>Recreational options in the Zone were plentiful and</p>
        <p>diverse; Sex, Trance, and Dance the most favored.</p>
        <p>Sliding through the press of bodies, constructs, and</p>
        <p>grams. G e n selected one of her favorite bonding</p>
        <p>booths, placed her hand on the palm code reader</p>
        <p>and entered. It was a booth Japanese, fitted out with</p>
        <p>futon, screens, antique pillow book, incense. As she</p>
        <p>had a rep for being the hottest bioconstruct on the</p>
        <p>block, the strangest attractor, she never had to wait</p>
        <p>long to replenish her slime banks.</p>
        <p>She had transmutated into an Hispanic model of</p>
        <p>human female, optimized for the slime exchange. Gen</p>
        <p>pleasured herself, familiarizing her sensors with the</p>
        <p>cool olive languidness of the body she had chosen.</p>
        <p>A screen by the door displayed the image of a visitor.</p>
        <p>Mistress Beg. Requesting entry. The door opened.</p>
        <p>Silk ropes in hand, the Mistress of Detestable</p>
        <p>Pleasure approached Gen. Beg's method of bonding</p>
        <p>was dangerous, addictive, and severe. Activated by</p>
        <p>stored memories, Gen's slime levels began a slow</p>
        <p>rise.</p>
        <p>The screen flickered on again. A geisha construct</p>
        <p>with a tray of sake and sashimi. S h e entered. Placed</p>
        <p>a redly laqueured tray on the low table. Served the</p>
        <p>sake. Waited. B e g instructed the geisha to return</p>
        <p>later, when her help would be required. Cruel</p>
        <p>anticipation. Gen's slime bank shivered to another</p>
        <p>level a s the geishacon scrolled out.</p>
