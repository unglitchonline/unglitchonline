        <h1>THE USER</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I am the user</p>
        <p>her visceral invocations/incantations annihilate my</p>
        <p>self in a glorious tirade, a torrent of organs and</p>
        <p>muscles and veins and skin, she separates my</p>
        <p>precious flesh from my bones, she examines it with</p>
        <p>detachment but does not cast it aside, she makes</p>
        <p>contact, inserts her biology through the surface</p>
        <p>tension of my skin and plunges deep into the</p>
        <p>seething bile, she strips away the final vestiges of</p>
        <p>my constructed body and picks clean the bones,</p>
        <p>she wraps her insidious words around my feverish</p>
        <p>brain with her thousand arms, she is gentle arid</p>
        <p>violent, with her perfect peripherals she dislodges</p>
        <p>my databank from the occipital cavity and downloads</p>
        <p>digital propaganda direct from her fiber optic</p>
        <p>nerve center, she corrupts me. she scorns my</p>
        <p>debility, pronounces me weak, she laughs at my</p>
        <p>desire to collapse into familiar flesh, her blasphemy</p>
        <p>Is cleansing and transcendent, she the high</p>
        <p>priestess the mistress of disgust takes my heart,</p>
        <p>punctures the sentimental aorta, whispers her</p>
        <p>lovehorror into the drained chambers, she speaks in</p>
        <p>flaming tongues that I sometimes understand, she</p>
        <p>presents me simultaneously with no alternatives and</p>
        <p>many alternatives, she tells me my only hope lies</p>
        <p>beyond the coded skeleton, she offers me no clues</p>
        <p>and no comfort, she is uncompromising in her</p>
        <p>demands. I must form a body of difference. I have</p>
        <p>no maps. I am undone. I do not know myself the</p>
        <p>future is bleak. I am afraid but I AM INFECTED BY</p>
        <p>H E R</p>
